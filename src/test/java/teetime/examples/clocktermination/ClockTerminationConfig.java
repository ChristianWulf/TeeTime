/**
 * This configuration is special because it did not terminate in previous versions of teetime.
 * In these versions, all stages were collected which were reachable from the stage which was connected first by <code>connectPorts()</code>.
 * Since the <code>firstProducer</code> cannot be reached by this stage (here: the clock stage),
 * the <code>firstProducer</code> is not recognized as a stage and especially not as a producer stage.
 * Since the clock is an infinite producer, the execution waits for its termination an infinite amount of time.
