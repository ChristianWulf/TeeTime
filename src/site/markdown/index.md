## What is it?

TeeTime is a Pipes-And-Filter-Framework for Java.
	
It provides various features, which will bring you to the next level of analysis programming, such like:
		
- Concurrent execution of stages
		
- Flexible connection between stages
		
- Typed ports
		
- Pre-defined stages and pipelines

## Where to get it

TeeTime is available in many ways. If your projects use Maven, just add following dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.sourceforge.teetime</groupId>
  <artifactId>teetime</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

To get the source code or the plain jar, take a look at the download section.

## Concurrency-aware

TeeTime takes care of a parallel execution of stages. You do not need to think about anything, as TeeTime creates and manages all threads, needed by your analysis.
