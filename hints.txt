-a pipeline needs to be a stage, too, to allow the composition of stages
-instead of using work-stealing, sort the input in desc order to process the most computationally intensive elements first (load-balancing)
-for a novice programmer, it is difficult to select the best choice and combination of patterns to maximize performance
-switch vs. farm:
	-switch: different branch logics
	-farm: same branch logics 
-if executed send() method, execute the corresponding successor stage at once to avoid scheduling, i.e., waste of performance
	-same thread:		send = put to pipe & execute corresponding successor stage
	-different thread:	send = put to pipe (only)
